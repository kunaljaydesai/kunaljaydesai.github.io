  Hey there! My name is Kunal and I am a software engineer at <a href="https://mightyapp.com/">Mighty</a>. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019 and was a software engineer at <a href="http://robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a> for a year and a half after. In Fall of 2020, I will start as a student at the <a href="https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/computer-science">Georgia Tech Online Masters in Computer Science program</a>. I'm particularly interested in computer systems, programming languages, and entrepreneurship. 
  <br><br>
  I also have a passion for playing sports like golf and badminton.
